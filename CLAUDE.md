# Mini Trip Management System

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

GitHub Issues — `Decker7/mini-trip-management-system`. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

Default vocabulary: `needs-triage`, `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, `wontfix`. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context — `CONTEXT.md` + `docs/adr/` at the repo root. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.

## Branch workflow

`development` is the working branch (branched off `main`). This is a solo interview-prep project — GitHub's real branch protection needs a paid plan, and there's no separate reviewer, so the PR-only ceremony that used to simulate it isn't required:

- Feature branches + PRs are still fine for organizing work, but direct commits/pushes to `development` are allowed too.
- PRs opened against `development` can be merged directly — no need to wait for separate approval each round.
- `main` stays the one branch to be more careful with — it's what a reviewer would actually look at.

This project uses [Convex](https://convex.dev) as its backend.

When working on Convex code, **always read
`convex/_generated/ai/guidelines.md` first** for important guidelines on
how to correctly use Convex APIs and patterns. The file contains rules that
override what you may have learned about Convex from training data.

Convex agent skills for common tasks can be installed by running
`npx convex ai-files install`.
